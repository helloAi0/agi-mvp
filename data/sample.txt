Artificial intelligence is the study of systems that can perceive, reason, learn, and act.
The goal of artificial intelligence is not merely to imitate human behavior, but to build
systems that can solve problems in flexible and general ways.

A key idea in intelligence is representation.
An intelligent system must represent information about the world, about itself, and about
its goals.
These representations may be symbolic, numerical, or learned implicitly from data.

Learning is the process by which an intelligent system improves its performance over time.
Learning can occur through experience, feedback, or observation.
A system that cannot learn is limited to the knowledge it was originally given.

Reasoning allows an intelligent system to draw conclusions from known information.
Logical reasoning involves applying rules to facts.
Probabilistic reasoning involves dealing with uncertainty and incomplete information.
Good reasoning systems are able to revise their beliefs when new evidence appears.

Planning is the ability to choose a sequence of actions to achieve a goal.
Planning requires predicting the consequences of actions and selecting those that lead to
desirable outcomes.
In complex environments, planning often involves breaking large problems into smaller steps.

Memory plays a central role in intelligence.
Short-term memory allows a system to focus on immediate tasks.
Long-term memory allows a system to accumulate knowledge and experience.
Episodic memory stores past events, while semantic memory stores general facts.

Language is a powerful tool for expressing and transferring knowledge.
Through language, intelligent systems can communicate ideas, ask questions, and explain
their reasoning.
Understanding language requires recognizing patterns, meanings, and context.

Modern machine learning systems often use neural networks.
Neural networks consist of layers of simple computational units.
By adjusting their internal parameters, these networks can approximate complex functions.

Transformers are a class of neural network architectures designed to handle sequences.
They use attention mechanisms to decide which parts of the input are most relevant.
This allows transformers to model long-range dependencies in language.

Attention works by comparing queries, keys, and values.
The system assigns higher weight to information that is more relevant to the current task.
This mechanism enables efficient processing of long sequences.

Large language models are trained on vast amounts of text.
They learn statistical patterns in language rather than explicit rules.
Despite this, they can exhibit surprisingly strong reasoning and generalization abilities.

However, language models also have limitations.
They may generate incorrect information or repeat common patterns without understanding.
Improving reliability and alignment is an active area of research.

Agentic systems extend language models by allowing them to act.
An agent can plan, use tools, observe results, and adjust its behavior.
Such systems combine perception, reasoning, and action in a loop.

Self-reflection is an important capability for advanced agents.
By evaluating their own outputs, agents can detect mistakes and improve future performance.
This process resembles metacognition in humans.

General intelligence requires the integration of many components.
No single algorithm is sufficient.
Instead, intelligence emerges from the interaction of learning, memory, reasoning, and action.

Building intelligent systems under resource constraints encourages careful design.
Limited compute forces engineers to focus on efficiency and structure.
This often leads to more elegant and understandable solutions.

Research in artificial intelligence continues to evolve rapidly.
New architectures, training methods, and evaluation techniques are constantly proposed.
Understanding foundational principles remains essential despite rapid progress.

Ultimately, the study of artificial intelligence is about understanding intelligence itself.
By building intelligent systems, we learn more about cognition, learning, and decision making.
This pursuit combines engineering, science, and philosophy.
