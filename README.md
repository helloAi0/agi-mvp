# AGI MVP (Laptop-Built)

This project implements a laptop-built agentic AI system demonstrating
autonomous reasoning, planning, memory, and multimodal intelligence.

## Goals
- Train a language model from scratch on consumer hardware
- Build agentic reasoning loops (plan → act → reflect)
- Add long-term memory and self-improvement
- Extend to multimodal understanding

## Status
Week 1: Tiny Transformer implementation (in progress)
